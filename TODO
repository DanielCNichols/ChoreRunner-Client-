Overall:
  ☐ Consistent naming (members? Kids? Households? Groups? Why would there be more than one household for the average user?)
  ☐ Header is indistinguishable from the body color. 
  ☐ Nice to see modals used for onboarding new users. 
  ☐ Tool-tips for icons. Should appear on hover. 
  ☐ Help modal for each page? Click the “?”. 
  ☐ Look into applying grid for all card-related designs.
  ☐ Make a service object for all  the methods. 
  
  Technical: 
  ☐ 1. Either do props or context. 
  
Desktop: 
  Landing page:
  
  ✔ Big open margin at the bottom of the screen on loading page. @done(20-03-23 09:58)
  ☐ Screenshots on loading page would look better with some depth.
  ☐ Put an overlay on the wording???
  ✔ Maybe use grid instead of flex @done(20-03-23 09:58)
  ✔ Fix the screenshots (Odd shrinking and the parent shots disappear on mobile) @done(20-03-23 09:58)
  
  Parent-Dashboard:
  ☐ Fix the forms so that they don’t always show. It looks cluttered.
  ✔ Made a reusable modal! Be sure to style and add cancel button @done(20-03-23 09:58)
  ☐ Fix the spacing on the forms so that the inputs and labels look more neat
  ☐ Fix the cards for the household
  ☐ Background/foreground shadowing for each card. Looks like there is some, but it mostly is hard to see due to coloring
  ☐ Something to offset each section of the card (Household/Group name vs member names.)
  ☐ Might be neat to show each member’s levels on this screen. 
  ☐ Collumns for names? 
  ☐ Editing household sends the edited household to the bottom of the screen. @started(20-03-23 09:59)
  
  Household page: 
  ☐ Fix card design as above (copy theming)
  ☐ Fix alignment of text and overflow issues with longer names. 
  ☐ Assign tasks modal should match the themes. 
  ☐ Assign tasks form might need to be triggered on each member, not at the top?? Idea
  
  Member Page: 
  ✔ THERE IS A NESTED SCROLL BAR? FIX THIS FIRST. @done(20-03-23 09:57)
  ✔ MemberDashboarda nd Member container are nested inside the app component. They need to match the height of the app??? @done(20-03-23 10:01)
  ✔ Task name needs to match the other basic wording. Use Electrolize sans serif. @done(20-03-23 10:04)
  ✔ Reworking the components to be grid design instead of flexbox would be helpful here. @done(20-03-24 15:56)
  ✔ Make LeaderBoard header bigger/more prominent @done(20-03-23 11:02)
  ✔ Make the top three seperate somehow from the rest. @done(20-03-23 11:02)
  ✔ Challenge container needs a “no challenges assigned message” @done(20-03-24 15:56)
  Clearing:
  ☐ Confirm that it is cleared? “Pending approval” on the task itself?
  ☐ Should task stay with a pending notification if awaiting parent approval?
  ☐ All cards should match width. 
  
  ☐ Could use error handling for if there is a problem on clearing.
